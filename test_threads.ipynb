Temperatures in the U.S. remain higher than normal for most of the country, according to a weather forecast from agricultural research firm DTN. Meanwhile, natural gas rigs in the U.S. increased by three, according to weekly data from Baker Hughes. Natural gas prices have been having difficulty breaking the $3 per mmBtu level, experiencing ‘psychological’ resistance at that level, according to EBW Analytics Group in a note.

Some analysts speculate that natural gas is in a position to cross that level soon, with Ritterbusch and Associates speculating that the price will exceed $3 within the next two weeks. “Overall balances appear to be improving gradually as the dynamic of surplus contraction remains much intact with another sizable reduction in the supply overhang expected in next week’s EIA [report],” says the firm in a note.

      "{'title': 'Oil Price Expected to Weaken If OPEC+ Hikes Supply', 'content': 'Prospects of additional oil supply hitting the market if OPEC+ sticks to its output plans are raising fears of a market surplus, painting a rather grim outlook for crude prices. \\nThe international benchmark Brent crude and the U.S. oil gauge West Texas Intermediate are down more than 4% this week and almost 10% on the month, as fears of a global demand slowdown continue to dampen sentiment. \\nThe number of short positions held by money managers in Brent futures in the last two weeks has exceeded the number of longs for the first time on record, according to market experts. \\n“Sentiment in the market is already weak, with a bearish macro narrative weighing heavily to the downside, and investors are currently far more responsive to bearish price drivers than to bullish ones,” BMI analysts said in a research note. \\nNow, expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will start unwinding voluntary output curbs of 2.2 million barrels a day starting from December is adding to market nervousness. Brent currently trades at around $71 a barrel, while WTI is around $68 a barrel, even as conflict in the Middle East escalates. \\nOPEC+ had agreed in June on a road map to gradually restore previously halted supplies starting from October, but then steep price losses in September prompted the group to postpone its plans by two months. According to market watchers, its decision was based on two factors: falling interest rates, which are materializing, and recovering demand, which instead hasn’t occurred. \\nIf implemented, the output hike plan would bring back 180,000 barrels per day into the market each month from December 2024 to November 2025. \\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported Thursday that Saudi Arabia—the world’s top crude exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC—is ready to abandon its unofficial oil price target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output. Oil prices fell more than 3% on the news. \\nAccording to analysts, such a prospect is set to weigh on prices in the short term, fuelling the idea that the Kingdom is no longer willing to give up market share and has sufficient alternative financing options to face a period of lower prices. \\n“In the mid-2010s, when OPEC targeted market share to push out high-cost oil shale producers in the U.S., the oil price collapsed to $30 a barrel,” ANZ Research’s strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said in a report. \\nANZ forecasts Brent crude at $65 a barrel in December and at $80-$82 a barrel in the second half of next year to reflect the phase out of OPEC+ cuts. \\n“Any sustainability in oil prices will be contingent on OPEC refraining from entering an all-out war on market share. We don’t expect Saudi Arabia will embark on another market flooding strategy, but the market will remain nervous until it explicitly rules it out,” the analysts said. \\nA price drop in the $30-a-barrel region is possible, but still represents a very pessimistic scenario, according to FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “Technically, the Brent price is testing support near $70,” the senior market analysts said. \\nBMI maintains its Brent forecast of $81 a barrel for this year and $78 a barrel for the next, but said “the balance of risk to the outlook lies to the downside.” Analysts at Bernstein instead said that, assuming OPEC+ brings back 2.2 million barrels a day starting in December, an oversupplied market and rising inventories could drive Brent down to a low of $55 a barrel, averaging around $60 a barrel in 2025. \\nNext week, OPEC+’s Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee is set to take place. The committee has no decision-making power as its role is confined to making policy recommendations for the OPEC+ ministerial meeting, which is expected to take place in December. \\nAccording to Commerbank Research’s Barbara Lambrecht, the JMMC will likely emphasize again that the implementation of the planned production hike depends on market conditions, and call for compliance with production targets and the implementation of compensatory cuts. \\nAdvertisement \\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/natural-gas-rises-on-west-coast-heat-storm-watches-1b5754ad'}\n",

      "{'title': 'China Harnesses a Technology That Vexed the West, Unlocking a Treasure Chest', 'content': 'Six years ago, Chinese engineers set out on a risky path to turn trash into treasure. \\nTheir target was the vast quantities of ore containing nickel and cobalt that blanket Indonesia’s distant islands but are of such low grade that they were treated as little more than waste. If the engineers could figure out how to process it, they would unlock a new source of not one but two minerals the world needs for electric-vehicle batteries. \\nThe main method long known to process this type of nickel, called High Pressure Acid Leach, or HPAL, was notoriously tricky. Western companies had tried to make it work but suffered high rates of failure. Scorching temperatures and enormous pressure involved in the process damaged equipment, requiring lengthy repairs. It generated vast amounts of\\xa0acidic waste\\xa0that is difficult to dispose of. \\nAttempts to design solutions often just created more problems.\\xa0 \\nThree Australian projects struggled in the 2000s, unable to reach capacity before their owners ended up in dire financial straits.\\xa0Western miners poured billions of dollars\\xa0into a facility in New Caledonia that didn’t work as intended and was ultimately sold off. \\nThe glitchy nature of the process inspired jokes, such as one about an operation in the Western Australian mining area of Murrin Murrin that had to be\\xa0revamped\\xa0shortly after it went into production: Why was Murrin Murrin called Murrin Murrin? Because they had to build it twice. \\nChinese engineers weren’t laughing.\\xa0 \\nIn a remote, forested\\xa0area of Papua New Guinea, a state-owned Chinese engineering company, China ENFI, spent years working out the kinks. At first, the facility had all the hallmarks of an HPAL bust. In its second year of operation in 2013, it produced at roughly\\xa040% of capacity. In 2016 a pipe burst, killing a worker and causing the plant to shut down for 78 days. \\nBut ENFI’s parent company,\\xa0a state-owned\\xa0miner,\\xa0had deep pockets and was able to persist through the predictably bumpy start. It bet that with enough time, it could get the plant working. By 2017, it had and was hitting design capacity. \\nAdvertisement \\n“A\\xa0five- to\\xa0six-year ramp-up would have crippled any Western company, which is why many HPAL projects are on their second owners—or gone,” said Lyle Trytten, a Canadian nickel-industry consultant who has been an engineer on HPAL projects around the world.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nThe Papua New Guinea plant marked a big shift from the early 2000s.\\xa0Back then, Chinese nickel know-how lagged behind the West in key areas. Chinese companies had little experience using acid to process ores at over 350 degrees. It was around then that China ENFI established a research unit to catch up. \\nIts eventual success in Papua New Guinea meant that hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians knew how to build and operate a thriving HPAL plant. Still, it wasn’t a given that they would be able to duplicate the success in Indonesia. Many analysts predicted they would encounter the same roadblocks and frequent breakdowns as Western plants had around the world.\\xa0 \\nA private Chinese company, Lygend Resources and Technology, plowed ahead and hired ENFI. They began preparing land for construction\\xa0in eastern Indonesia’s Obi Island in December 2018, even before the detailed engineering design was finalized for the plant, according to a person familiar with the project.\\xa0Experienced Chinese engineers flew to the site, which offered few amenities other than cold-water showers and bunk beds.\\xa0 \\n“Chinese engineers have a different attitude toward life and work,” said Wang Duodong, Lygend’s chief engineer. “In order to do their job well, they are willing to spend a lot of time working in such remote construction sites.” \\nThey tweaked the process where needed, such as switching to a cheaper type of titanium. They used a\\xa0technique to reduce the moisture level of the final nickel product to improve efficiency, said Wang. Lygend hunted down Chinese companies that could make cheaper versions of Western equipment.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nAt the time, companies from Japan and the West were taking a cautious stance, concerned about costs and potential environmental damage.\\xa0At the Chinese-run plant in Papua New Guinea, a pump failure in 2019 caused mineral slurry\\xa0to overflow a tank into nearby waters, providing a glimpse of the risks.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nAdvertisement \\nThat didn’t appear to slow the Indonesian project,\\xa0which was a partnership between Lygend and Harita Nickel, an Indonesian miner. \\nBy 2021,\\xa0the first two production lines were up\\xa0and running at full capacity. \\nWang said Lygend wasn’t trying to reinvent the wheel. Their focus was to keep the plant design simple and streamlined, and to automate as much as possible to reduce errors, he said. They studied the Western projects that hadn’t worked.\\xa0 \\n“We actually learned from these failed projects, analyzed their disadvantages,” said Wang. “We made improvements.” \\nA wave of Chinese-run facilities followed. Today, there are\\xa0at least\\xa0four such HPAL plants that are operational across Indonesia,\\xa0with three more projects expected by the end of next year. \\nWestern miners say Chinese companies gain unfair advantages from access to cheap government loans and because they pay scant regard to labor rights and the environment. In Indonesia, Chinese companies have built numerous coal plants to power their nickel rush—expanding the use of a dirty fossil fuel the world is trying to cut back on.\\xa0 \\nAdvertisement \\nThere has been a spate of deadly accidents, including an explosion at a Chinese nickel smelter on Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island that killed at least 19 workers in December.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nBut many Western miners and analysts also say that Chinese mineral companies had a critical breakthrough with HPAL and are good at processing minerals.\\xa0 \\n“A classic example is just how quickly they brought on the Indonesian nickel projects using a technology that had a checkered history,” said William Adams, head of base-metals research for Fastmarkets, a data provider. \\nChina’s success has reshaped the industry. It has infused significant new supply into the market and accelerated a crash in the prices of nickel and cobalt, knocking out Western competitors. The share of the global nickel supply refined within China or by Chinese companies abroad has risen from 34% in 2015 to 58% this year, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. \\nMeanwhile nickel and cobalt mines in Australia, France-controlled New Caledonia, Brazil and the U.S. have closed or are being shut, unable to compete with the surge in low-cost Chinese minerals. Australian mining company BHP said in July that it would suspend its West Australian nickel operations, expecting a continuing flood of cheap nickel.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nGerman chemical company BASF and French miner Eramet, which had signed an agreement in 2020 to look into building an HPAL facility in eastern Indonesia, called off their plan this year. “The global nickel market has changed significantly,” the German company said.  \\nWrite to Jon Emont at jonathan.emont@wsj.com \\nAdvertisement \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-harnesses-a-technology-that-vexed-the-west-unlocking-a-treasure-chest-5d984585'}\n",

The outlay is likely the largest ever in the opaque market designed to forestall tree harvesting in the U.S. \\nThe idea behind the offsets is that rather than cut down trees for wood, leave them standing and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. \\nCarbon offset sales \\nSource: Aurora Sustainable Lands \\nAlana Pipe/WSJ \\nCarbon offset sales \\nSource: Aurora Sustainable Lands \\nAlana Pipe/WSJ \\nCompanies often voluntarily purchase offsets to satisfy their own emissions targets rather than to meet regulatory mandates. Those sold by major U.S. timberland owners have been a fairly resilient pocket in a carbon-credit market otherwise plagued by allegations of fraud and overstated environmental benefits. \\nTotalEnergies said it is amassing offsets to make up for greenhouse-gas emissions that it cannot eliminate by 2030. Before this year, it had committed $725 million to offsets generated by preserving or restoring natural carbon sinks around the world, including wetlands and forests.\\xa0 \\nThe seller in its latest purchase is Aurora Sustainable Lands, which was created two years ago to carry out Wall Street’s biggest wager yet on forest offsets. Investors led by T. Rowe Price Group subsidiary Oak Hill Advisors—best known as a corporate-debt investor—paid about $1.8 billion for nearly 1.7 million acres of hardwood forests spread over 17 Eastern states. The latest sale will involve about 740,000 acres.\\xa0 \\nAurora has since reduced harvest volumes by more than 50% on the properties, said Aurora Chief Executive Jamie Houston. \\n“Historically, harvests were based on creating the highest timber revenue,” Houston said. “Now harvests are based on creating a multidecade carbon sink on all of these properties.” \\nIn some cases, that means cutting down trees, such as planted pine, and letting the plots reseed naturally from nearby hardwoods. In others it means leaving alone trees that live long and grow large, such as the cypress in Aurora’s Louisiana woodlands, Houston said.\\xa0 \\nAurora has initiated carbon projects—which involve a lot of tree measuring—and is generating offsets on all of its properties, he said. \\nAurora sold more than $100 million of offsets to various buyers last year. It sold another bunch to Microsoft this year in a deal arranged, like the one with TotalEnergies, by its partner, Anew Climate.\\xa0 \\nAnew determined how much carbon is on the properties, registered the offsets with accrediting groups and found the buyer, said Josh Strauss, Anew’s president of environmental products.\\xa0It also\\xa0manages verification, he added. \\n“They use the highest available voluntary-market standards,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nTotalEnergies declined to say how many offsets the $100 million will buy and the exact time frame for the deal. Each offset represents 1 metric ton of sequestered carbon dioxide. \\nAdvertisement \\nPrices for most voluntary forest offsets are negotiated privately and not widely known. Weyerhaeuser, the largest U.S. private landowner, late last year sold voluntary offsets associated with reduced logging in its North Maine Woods timberlands for $29 apiece.\\xa0 \\nThat is much higher than in the broader global market for various emissions offsets, which has been beset by allegations of fraud and greenwashing. Studies and news articles have shown some projects had vastly overstated their impact on emissions.\\xa0 \\nA glut of voluntary emissions offsets and concerns about quality have depressed prices for many types of carbon credits around the world. Offset futures prices have plunged from about $12 in November 2021 to less than $1 recently, according to Bank of America analysts.\\xa0 \\nWhat is your outlook on forest offsets as a way to reach a goal of net-zero emissions? Join the conversation below. \\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees U.S. derivatives markets, said last year that it would make policing carbon offsets a priority. The Biden administration in May issued guidelines aimed at bolstering trust in voluntary carbon markets. \\nTotalEnergies said it would use credits to offset Scope 1 emissions, which come directly from its operations, and Scope 2 emissions from its energy purchases. Those are the types of emissions that the Securities and Exchange Commission said it will require companies to disclose starting in fiscal year 2026.\\xa0 \\nAdrien Henry, vice president for nature-based solutions at TotalEnergies Exploration & Production, said that although the company is buying offsets at a clip of about $100 million a year, it is giving priority to reducing emissions over the remainder of this decade.\\xa0 \\n“We will start offsetting some of our residual emissions in 2030 and ramp up so that in 2050 TotalEnergies is net zero,” he said. “The rest of the journey is avoiding and reducing emissions by a lot of other actions.”\\xa0 \\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/an-oil-giant-is-spending-100-million-to-preserve-u-s-forests-24b4f4b8'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Vital That Coffee Industry Adapts to Climate Change, Illy Chairman Says', 'content': 'Coffee producers have to adapt to climate change in order for global prices to stabilize, said Andrea Illy, chairman of Illycaffè and third generation heir of the Italian company’s dynasty. \\nCoffee prices have reached record highs this year, and are unlikely to retreat any time soon as poor weather conditions in the world’s main growing regions—Vietnam and Brazil—squeeze global production. The price of arabica futures has risen nearly 70% over the past year, while robusta coffee futures have more than doubled. \\nEfforts to curb climate change include the European Union’s Deforestation Regulation—or EUDR—which aims to guarantee that consumer products don’t contribute to deforestation. The regulation was supposed to come into force by the end of the year, but the EU Commission proposed a one-year delay amid pressure from industries and governments. \\nIlly talked about the effects of climate change on coffee prices and the challenges the sector is facing. The following has been edited for length and clarity. \\nQ: What factors are driving coffee prices at the moment? \\nClimate change is heavily impacting coffee agriculture. Coffee grows in a very narrow climatic band, both in terms of temperature and moisture, and requires a circular, regular pattern. Climate change is giving us the exact opposite of regular climate conditions. The evil in the room is the so-called “ENSO cycle,” which is the alternation of the El Nino and the La Nina. El Nino causes heat waves with extreme drought, while La Nina is excessive rain and cold weather. What is increasing is the peak heat of El Nino. \\nLatin America, where two-thirds of coffee is grown, is the most impacted region. In Brazil, the effect of climate change is amplified as a result of the deforestation of the Atlantic Forest around a century ago. So we have twice as high global warming in the Minas Gerais regions where coffee is grown compared to other places in the world. \\nIt’s unpredictable… we weren’t expecting such a mess this year. Extreme weather in Brazil and extreme drought in Vietnam triggered a rally in prices, which we didn’t foresee. With these weather patterns, we can expect lower output in the years to come, which is the perfect trigger for market speculation. The situation is getting more and more volatile. \\nQ: What conditions do we need for prices to normalize? \\nIn the immediate term, we need rain in Brazil, and the price will fall immediately. But in the long term, we need countries to adapt to climate change. Brazil is an exception, as it’s the most competitive coffee-producing country with around 40% of global output and a substantial number of growers with good financing terms from the state. So Brazil can invest in adaptation, but most of the rest of the world is made up of small holders. \\nThere are more or less 12 million hectares cultivated with coffee around the world, and around 12 and a half million growers. The average grower cultivates far below one hectare. How could they grow larger, or invest in adapting to climate change, if they are receiving just 5% of the wholesale value of [a cup of] coffee? There is absolutely not enough in terms of cash flow and margins to reinvest part of your income in adaptation. Price volatility makes it even more difficult. So we need improving economic practices. \\nWhat’s also needed is the renewal of plantations. In Brazil, they substitute plants every 12 to 15 years. In some countries, there are plants which are 80 years to a century old. You can guess how little productivity they have and how little resilience they have against pathogens or any kind of adverse factors. So what we have been advocating for many years is to create the conditions for consuming countries to invest in those plantations… even through a public-private fund. \\nQ: Has the company been able to absorb the cost increases itself? \\nWe try to strike a balance. We try to absorb costs temporarily. Of course, from time to time we have windows where we adjust our pricing, but in general, we don’t adjust our pricing to cover temporary market cost increases. It’s a kind of an acrobatic gym exercise every time, but it’s something we’re starting to get used to. \\nQ: What are the main challenges that the EU deforestation law poses to the industry? Has Illy taken any steps to prepare for when this regulation comes into force? \\nThe EUDR is motivated by good intentions. We have to stop deforesting for agriculture… But in the timeframe considered by the regulation, coffee didn’t undergo substantial deforestation. \\nWe pioneer direct sourcing and we have a team of agronomists checking that there’s no deforestation or unsustainable labor conditions. We now have traceability for each and every coffee plantation, each and every coffee lot, each and every coffee bean. So we did prepare ourselves for any possible consequences [of the EUDR], including replacing some components of our blends with some from other countries. But imagine a company that buys through traders, and traders buy through cooperatives… you completely lose traceability. \\nThe concern is more for the weakest part of the coffee chain, which are coffee growers in producing countries, particularly the less fortunate ones. Take for example Ethiopia. 40% of the coffee grown in Ethiopia is exported to Europe, which is by far the largest consuming region. Should they not be in the capacity to export to Europe any longer, they could redirect some of the coffee to other countries like the U.S. or in Asia, but not 40%. You would have 20% of people left jobless and forced to leave their land, which translates into a potential humanitarian crisis. \\nQ: What would you like the EU to change or amend when it comes to this regulation? \\nTo simplify the procedure. For instance, a mechanism that requires producers to ensure that a coffee region or plantation is deforestation free. Some kind of self-certification mechanism. And also to give time to adjust. If you have deforested land, you can set a road map for restoring what has been deforested, with some time and some funds. There also needs to be more of a carrot and stick approach to companies, rather than just the stick. [The EU] helps you improve your sustainability with targets and regulation. Then if you don’t comply, you get punished. This would be ideal, because it could also create some complicity. \\nAdvertisement \\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com and Joseph Hoppe at joseph.hoppe@wsj.com \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/vital-that-coffee-industry-adapts-to-climate-change-illy-chairman-says-40daff6b'}\n",

They aim to buoy prices that have rarely been lower during the heat of the summer, when air conditioning creates a lot of power demand. \\nBenchmark natural-gas futures ended Tuesday at $2.198 per million British thermal units, down 14% from a year ago and 30% less than the recent peak in mid-June. \\nFutures were even lower at the beginning of this month, trading below $2, before producers began disclosing plans to dial down output. Aside from the crash during 2020’s Covid-19 lockdown, summer natural-gas prices hadn’t been so low since the 1990s. \\n“Simply put, gas markets are oversupplied,” Coterra Chief Executive Thomas Jorden told investors this month, when the Houston company mapped out plans to reduce production in its Appalachian gas fields. \\nU.S. gas output hit a daily record of 105 billion cubic feet in December, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. An unusually warm winter left a lot of gas unburned during heating season. By spring, the market was swamped and prices tumbled. A round of production curtailments lifted prices but they were driven back down by resurgent output.\\xa0 \\nMeanwhile, storms have hit demand hard. Hurricane Beryl knocked out power for millions of Texans and big gas consumers on the Gulf Coast, including a terminal that exports liquefied natural gas, or LNG. This month tornadoes blacked out hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses around Cleveland.\\xa0 \\nThe volume of natural gas in domestic storage facilities is 13% higher than the five-year average for this time of year despite record demand this summer from utilities, according to the Energy Information Administration.\\xa0 \\nThat is down from a 40% surplus in March, when gas prices hit inflation-adjusted record lows. But there is still enough gas stockpiled to warm the U.S. through even an unusually cold winter and leave a comfortable cushion for spring, said Joe DeLaura, global energy strategist at Rabobank, which recently trimmed its winter price forecasts. \\nThere are more than two months to go before furnaces are fired up and gas demand exceeds daily production. Until then, production in excess of demand is injected into underground storage caverns by traders eyeing higher winter prices. The more gas that winds up in storage ahead of winter, the lower the prices consumers are likely to pay when it comes time to heat their homes.\\xa0 \\n“Everything from today until the end of October is like extra padding,” DeLaura said. “It’s pretty hard to make a bullish case.”\\xa0 \\nProducers lately have been acting more like traders than in past years, when they drilled to boost production, often without regard to profitability. For the second time this year producers including EQT, APA and Chesapeake Energy are holding back gas from the market while prices are low. \\nSo far this month analysts say production has declined by more than two billion cubic feet a day, which is about equal to the daily consumption of a small city or the largest LNG-export terminals.\\xa0 \\nWhat is your outlook on the natural-gas industry? Join the conversation below. \\nThat is partly due to the curtailments, which quickly remove supply from the market, as well as the delayed effect of less drilling since spring. There were 98 rigs drilling in the U.S. specifically for natural gas last week, down from more than 120 in February, according to oil-field services firm Baker Hughes. \\nGas executives and analysts say it takes six to nine months for reduced drilling to show up in production data.\\xa0 \\n“We’re seeing markets function efficiently and producers responding the way you would expect them to respond,” said Eric McGuire, director of natural gas and LNG analytics at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. “The thing that is shocking is that they haven’t really done this before; it’s a new producer paradigm.” \\nAdvertisement \\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/a-natural-gas-glut-is-forcing-drillers-to-dial-backagain-ff2e56a1'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Why Washington and Big Oil Are Investing Billions in Ammonia', 'content': 'Most people think of ammonia as a household cleaner. To big oil companies, climate investors and the U.S. government, it is a hot commodity that is attracting billions of dollars for its use in fertilizer and low-carbon energy.\\xa0 \\nThe latest bet is a $1.56 billion Energy Department loan commitment for an ammonia project in Indiana. The agreement comes on top of a recent $2.35 billion deal for a Gulf Coast project by an Australia-based energy company, a big investment from Abu Dhabi’s national oil company in an Exxon Mobil XOM 1.84%increase; green up pointing triangle project in Texas and a large effort in Mississippi from ammonia giant CF Industries CF 0.96%increase; green up pointing triangle. \\nAmmonia, which is a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen, has long been a critical ingredient in fertilizer, but it is also a big emitter of greenhouse gases because it is typically made using fossil fuels. Projects like the one in Indiana are considered low-carbon because they trap the CO2 emissions from the process and bury them underground.\\xa0 \\nAmmonia doesn’t produce carbon emissions when burned as fuel, driving a new wave of activity from companies angling to ship it all over the world. Increasing domestic supply is a priority after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 roiled the market and pushed up prices. Russia is one of the world’s biggest producers.\\xa0 \\n“It’s important for us to have a diverse supply chain and make sure we’re not dependent on other countries for this really important chemical,” Jigar Shah, head of the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, said in an interview. The program is rushing to get deals done before the election.\\xa0 \\nThe office has agreed to a deal with Wabash Valley Resources, a producer backed by oil companies and hydrogen-vehicle startup\\xa0Nikola NKLA -3.27%decrease; red down pointing triangle. The company aims to repurpose a facility that was part of a decades-old coal plant in Indiana for low-carbon ammonia production. \\nFounded in 2016, Wabash uses a byproduct of oil refining to make ammonia and says it has an advantage over competitors because its facility is close to the farms where fertilizer will be used to grow corn. It expects to produce 500,000 metric tons of ammonia a year.\\xa0 \\nThe deal also adds to recent investments in carbon capture, which has a poor track record but got billions of dollars in tax credits from the 2022 climate law. Projects such as Wabash’s are seen as more practical because they use a proven process to trap a nearly pure stream of CO2.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nOnce it starts operating in 2027, Wabash expects to get about $140 million in carbon sequestration tax credits annually on top of the loan. The company’s project previously got government grants for studying carbon storage options near its plant in West Terre Haute, Ind., which set the table for Environmental Protection Agency approval of storage wells. \\nWabash still needs to raise about $800 million in equity and meet other project milestones before it starts receiving the loan. Daniel Williams, chief operating officer, said the company has about 75% of that equity funding in place and is talking to corporate partners.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nAdvertisement \\nAnother low-carbon ammonia producer, Nebraska startup Monolith, received a $1 billion commitment from the loan office in 2021 but still hasn’t received the funds.\\xa0 \\nOn the Gulf Coast, Australia-based Woodside Energy WDS 0.71%increase; green up pointing triangle recently paid $2.35 billion for a plant in Beaumont, Texas, where it plans to make low-carbon ammonia. A nearby Exxon low-carbon ammonia project has a deal with Abu Dhabi’s national oil company and is in talks for additional cash from Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi 8058 0.13%increase; green up pointing triangle. \\nExxon is also working with CF Industries on its carbon-capture effort in Mississippi and a similar project in Louisiana as part of its push into carbon management.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nSubsidies are critical for the projects because rising costs are derailing many climate efforts, fueling a series of bankruptcies in recent months. Williams said Wabash’s equipment and project costs have risen about 25% to 50% in the past three years. Cost setbacks have hurt many projects involving only hydrogen, which is difficult to store and transport.\\xa0 \\nWabash still needs to build the transportation infrastructure to carry the carbon several miles to storage sites, a process that has angered opponents of the development. Williams said the ammonia will have as much as 80% lower emissions than traditional ammonia and that the government support shows the project is worthy of development. The EPA received more than 1,000 public comments during its storage permit review. \\nThe deal is the loan program’s first involving carbon capture and adds to a push by the office to get money out the door before the election. A victory by former President Donald Trump could halt transactions and make the program essentially dormant like it was during the first Trump administration. \\nWhat is your outlook on the ammonia space? Join the conversation below. \\nSome analysts say certain deals could still get done if Trump wins because oil companies favor ammonia and carbon capture.

      "{'title': 'Oil Price Expected to Weaken If OPEC+ Hikes Supply', 'content': 'Prospects of additional oil supply hitting the market if OPEC+ sticks to its output plans are raising fears of a market surplus, painting a rather grim outlook for crude prices. \\nThe international benchmark Brent crude and the U.S. oil gauge West Texas Intermediate are down more than 4% this week and almost 10% on the month, as fears of a global demand slowdown continue to dampen sentiment. \\nThe number of short positions held by money managers in Brent futures in the last two weeks has exceeded the number of longs for the first time on record, according to market experts. \\n“Sentiment in the market is already weak, with a bearish macro narrative weighing heavily to the downside, and investors are currently far more responsive to bearish price drivers than to bullish ones,” BMI analysts said in a research note. \\nNow, expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will start unwinding voluntary output curbs of 2.2 million barrels a day starting from December is adding to market nervousness. Brent currently trades at around $71 a barrel, while WTI is around $68 a barrel, even as conflict in the Middle East escalates. \\nOPEC+ had agreed in June on a road map to gradually restore previously halted supplies starting from October, but then steep price losses in September prompted the group to postpone its plans by two months. According to market watchers, its decision was based on two factors: falling interest rates, which are materializing, and recovering demand, which instead hasn’t occurred. \\nIf implemented, the output hike plan would bring back 180,000 barrels per day into the market each month from December 2024 to November 2025. \\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported Thursday that Saudi Arabia—the world’s top crude exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC—is ready to abandon its unofficial oil price target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output.

      "{'title': 'Oil Price Expected to Weaken If OPEC+ Hikes Supply', 'content': 'Prospects of additional oil supply hitting the market if OPEC+ sticks to its output plans are raising fears of a market surplus, painting a rather grim outlook for crude prices. \\nThe international benchmark Brent crude and the U.S. oil gauge West Texas Intermediate are down more than 4% this week and almost 10% on the month, as fears of a global demand slowdown continue to dampen sentiment. \\nThe number of short positions held by money managers in Brent futures in the last two weeks has exceeded the number of longs for the first time on record, according to market experts. \\n“Sentiment in the market is already weak, with a bearish macro narrative weighing heavily to the downside, and investors are currently far more responsive to bearish price drivers than to bullish ones,” BMI analysts said in a research note. \\nNow, expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will start unwinding voluntary output curbs of 2.2 million barrels a day starting from December is adding to market nervousness. Brent currently trades at around $71 a barrel, while WTI is around $68 a barrel, even as conflict in the Middle East escalates. \\nOPEC+ had agreed in June on a road map to gradually restore previously halted supplies starting from October, but then steep price losses in September prompted the group to postpone its plans by two months. According to market watchers, its decision was based on two factors: falling interest rates, which are materializing, and recovering demand, which instead hasn’t occurred. \\nIf implemented, the output hike plan would bring back 180,000 barrels per day into the market each month from December 2024 to November 2025. \\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported Thursday that Saudi Arabia—the world’s top crude exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC—is ready to abandon its unofficial oil price target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output. Oil prices fell more than 3% on the news. \\nAccording to analysts, such a prospect is set to weigh on prices in the short term, fuelling the idea that the Kingdom is no longer willing to give up market share and has sufficient alternative financing options to face a period of lower prices. \\n“In the mid-2010s, when OPEC targeted market share to push out high-cost oil shale producers in the U.S., the oil price collapsed to $30 a barrel,” ANZ Research’s strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said in a report. \\nANZ forecasts Brent crude at $65 a barrel in December and at $80-$82 a barrel in the second half of next year to reflect the phase out of OPEC+ cuts. \\n“Any sustainability in oil prices will be contingent on OPEC refraining from entering an all-out war on market share. We don’t expect Saudi Arabia will embark on another market flooding strategy, but the market will remain nervous until it explicitly rules it out,” the analysts said. \\nA price drop in the $30-a-barrel region is possible, but still represents a very pessimistic scenario, according to FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “Technically, the Brent price is testing support near $70,” the senior market analysts said. \\nBMI maintains its Brent forecast of $81 a barrel for this year and $78 a barrel for the next, but said “the balance of risk to the outlook lies to the downside.” Analysts at Bernstein instead said that, assuming OPEC+ brings back 2.2 million barrels a day starting in December, an oversupplied market and rising inventories could drive Brent down to a low of $55 a barrel, averaging around $60 a barrel in 2025. \\nNext week, OPEC+’s Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee is set to take place. The committee has no decision-making power as its role is confined to making policy recommendations for the OPEC+ ministerial meeting, which is expected to take place in December. \\nAccording to Commerbank Research’s Barbara Lambrecht, the JMMC will likely emphasize again that the implementation of the planned production hike depends on market conditions, and call for compliance with production targets and the implementation of compensatory cuts. \\nAdvertisement \\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com \\n', 'link': 'https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/natural-gas-lower-as-weather-forecast-moderates-af18f74b'}\n",
